# 2025 Workshop on Testing and Securing User Interfaces in CI/CD Pipelines

User interfaces (UIs) define the modes through which humans interact with software-based systems, affecting product quality and user experiences. To verify the behavior of software, UI testing is crucial to inspect visual elements and ensure that software function as intended. However, UI testing is challenging---and an increasing number of security vulnerabilities can be exploited through UIs. Further, rapid release processes, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), are essential in modern software development to integrate, test, and deploy software chages to users efficiently. However, testing and securing UIs in CI/CD is challenging due to the complexity of user interfaces. As UI-based attacks become more prevalent and complex, novel solutions are needed to assess the security of UIs in rapid release environments.

This workshop aims to explore the intersections of testing and securing UIs in CI/CD pipelines. We invite cybersecurity, UI, and software development-focused researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to participate in this event. The workshop will be organized as an interactive "working group", featuring research presentations to elicit feedback on preliminary research findings and interactive discussions focused on uncovering challenges in current practices and brainstorming solutions to motivate techniques to support testing and securing user interfaces in CI/CD workflows.

## Workshop Schedule

The workshop will be held on **```Saturday, May 10th```** from **```10:00am-2:15pm```** in **```Room TBD```**. A brief overview of the schedule is below:
